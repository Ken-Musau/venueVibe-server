Problem Statement
The main aim is to bring and develop a community of like minded people who have the same passion in a particular area and they would really want to share the experience with other people of the passion within a cool environment generated by a willing owner.
Solution
A platform that will bring people together to meet, create, and celebrate. An online marketplace will make it easier than ever to find and book unique spaces for any activity.
A platform that will enable people to meet, create (collaborate with colleagues ) and celebrate (a major milestone). Space owners around the country can lease their property and make it available for rent by the hour/ day for people seeking a location for their next meeting, event or activity.
